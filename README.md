This application attempts to recreate the Metro UI of Late-Milestone 2/Early-Milestone 3 builds of Windows 8, The 79xx series of builds. This project targets the earlier 79xx builds, however, some parts of later 79xx builds (such as 7989) are used.

+ Charms Bar
+ Control Panel
+ Immersive Internet Explorer
+ MS Help
+ OOBE
+ Start Screen
+ Task UI (Task Manager)

## Credits for sources
+ Megadeth, screenshots and TeamViewer session
+ Betawiki's pages for 7927, 7955, 7963, and maybe some parts of 7989.
